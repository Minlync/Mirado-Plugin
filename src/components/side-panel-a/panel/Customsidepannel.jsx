            <p>Vincent Van Goghâ€™s Self-Portrait Dedicated to Paul Gauguin, painted in 1888, depicts the artist with a monastic severity. 
                The portrait measures 24 x 19-11/16 inches and is oil on canvas. 
                Van Gogh chose to represent himself with pale, ghostly features. 
                The painting was created during his time in Arles as he sought to establish an artistic community. </p>
